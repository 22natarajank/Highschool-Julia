The purpose of these pluto notebooks is for learning the basic concepts in Julia such as variables, types (etc). By learning this content, I will be able to add to my other application based notebooks, making them more efficient, simplified, and more professional. I have converted lessons from TechyTok into pluto notebooks to allow me to play around with the code and observe what happens when I make various adjustments. In the future, I hope to use this material to run an Intro to Julia course for my peers and continue to learn more about the language and the various ways to implement it in other subjects I am learning.
