This section delves into various topics in chemistry such as gases, rates of reaction, equilibrium, (etc.). All of the content originates from the AP Chemistry 2020-2021 course. I use the pluto notebooks to help solidify my understanding of these topics for quizzes and tests. I also have tried to make each notebook more and more interactive so other students may utilize this resource for their test preparation. In the future, I hope to create an extensive library of notebooks with more topics such as thermodynamics as well as learn how to create diagrams for various molecules. I also hope to model more chemical reactions that constantly occur in the real world. 


A notebook on Gases is here [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fonsp/pluto-on-binder/master?urlpath=pluto/open?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/22natarajank/Highschool-Julia/main/chemistry/gases.jl)

A notebook on kinetics is [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fonsp/pluto-on-binder/master?urlpath=pluto/open?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/22natarajank/Highschool-Julia/main/chemistry/kinetics.jl)

A notebook on equilibrium is [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fonsp/pluto-on-binder/master?urlpath=pluto/open?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/22natarajank/Highschool-Julia/main/chemistry/Equilibrium.jl)
