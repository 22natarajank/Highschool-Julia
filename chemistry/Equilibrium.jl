md" ## _Equilibrium_
Equilibrium occurs when the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are the same. This means that the concentrations of the reactants and the products will not change. Equilibrium is temperature dependent, which means a change in temperature will affect the equilibrium balance.

md" ## Dynamic Equilibrium
You can tell a reaction is in dynamic equilibrium from the equation based on the arrows. An equation at equilibrium will have arrows going in both the forward and reverse direction. Here is an example:

$\ce{N2(g) + 3H2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NH3(g)}$

If a reaction is at equilibrium then the concentration of the products and the reactants will NOT change. However, the concentrations of products and reactants do NOT need to be equal, they just cannot change in the equilibrium state.

md" ## Equilibrium Expression
Taking the same equation from above, you can write a general equilibrium expression to find `K`, which is the ratio of products to reactants. For the equation

$\ce{aA(g) + bB(g) \rightleftharpoons cC + dD(g)}$
The equilibrium equation is

$\ce{K =\frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}}$

The capital letters contain the concentrations of the either the product or the reactants. The lowercase letters are the coefficents. 
If you look at the example creating ammonia, the equilibrium equation is

$\ce{K =\frac{[NH3]^2}{[N2]^1[H2]^3}}$

When writing these expressions, there is one important thing to note.
 *Pure solids and liquids will NOT APPEAR in the equilibrium expression.* This is because they are in condensed states so its harder to change concentrations and they are less affected by variables such as pressure or temperature. They also react less frequently. Gases and aqueous solutions behave the opposite, and changes in pressure and temperature affect `K`, which is why they are included.

There is also another way of writing the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressure. Using the same general equation from above, the partial pressure equilibrium expression is

$\ce{K =\frac{(P(C))^c(P(D))^d}{(P(A))^a(P(B))^b}}$ 

where P(C) is the partial pressure of the product C.
